OP2 is an API with associated libraries and preprocessors to generate
parallel executables for applications on unstructured grids.

This repository contains the implementation of the run-time library
and the preprocessor, and is structured as follows:

|
`- op2: Implementation of the user and run-time OP2 C and Fortran APIs
|
`- apps: Application examples in C and Fortran
|
|  These are examples of user application code and also include
|  the target code an OP2 preprocessor should produce to correctly
|  use the OP2 run-time library.
|
`- scripts: simple bash scripts for testing OP2 backends and applications
|
`- translator: MATLAB and Pyton OP2 preprocessor for C and Fortran
|
`- doc: Documentation

For build instructions see README files located under op2/c (for C/C++ backend libs), 
op2/fortran (for Fortran backend libs) and apps/c (for C/C++ API based examples).
